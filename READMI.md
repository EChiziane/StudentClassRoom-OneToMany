This simple CRUD application depicts the relationship between a student and a classroom.

## Features:
- **Create:** Add new students and classrooms.
- **Read:** Retrieve information about students and classrooms.
- **Update:** Modify student or classroom details.
- **Delete:** Remove students or classrooms from the system.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Configure the PostgreSQL database settings in `application.properties`.
4. Run the application.
5. Access the CRUD operations through the defined endpoints.

## Endpoints:
